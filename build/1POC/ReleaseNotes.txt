Release Notes version 1 POC

-Demos the main jump on randomly generated platforms mechanic.

-Spawn platforms with some randomness.
-Deactiveate platforms offscreen.
-Object pooling for instatiated platforms.
-Camera following.
-Jump and move.
-Score track not implimented.
-Sheep collectables not implimented.

-Object pooling allows platforms to be reusable. Also allows generation and keeping track of of different sized platforms.

-TestController controls movement and jump. Spreading movement directions over 4 if() statements and an additional script was making the jump snap up and jarring. 

-Character stays on screen in the X axis. Y axis bounds have been left open so that 1) The player can progress up and 2) Fall out of screen when knocked off a platform.

-Camera follows player but will adjust how it does so in vertical slice. This PoC camera build is to show platforms benethe the player deactivate once they pass a certain point. There is no End state yet, so the player will be stranded until game is reset.

-No reset on falling off yet, but block to the left hand of the screen will rest the game.
